# ParOpt: A parallel interior-point optimizer #

This is an implementation of a parallel optimizer for use in large-scale topology and multi-material optimization problems. The optimizer has the capability to handle large numbers of weighting constraints that arise in the parametrization of multi-material problems. 

The implementation of the optimizer is in C++ and uses MPI.
